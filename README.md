# rubbish_classifier
Project of training the classifier of plastics and Tetra Pak.
In Poland, both types of rubbish go to the same bins and cannot be sorted mechanically, hence the idea for this project was invented..
The model was created using the transfer learning method on the basis of ResNet101V2 from the TensorFlow 2.1 library. The model is supported by the Rasberry Pi 3.
